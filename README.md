# BOOTS: A Modern TypeScript Curriculum for Teaching OOP

## What is BOOTS?

- [A textbook](https://boots-edu.github.io/textbook/)
- [A framework](https://boots-edu.github.io/Webz/)
- And so much more!

**BOOTS (Beginner Object-Oriented TypeScript)** is an open-source curriculum designed to teach **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and modern software development concepts in a second-semester Computer Science course (CS2). BOOTS integrates **TypeScript** and **web development** to provide students with practical, industry-relevant skills.

Traditionally, CS2 courses focus on OOP with languages like Java. BOOTS reimagines CS2 by leveraging **TypeScript**, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, to introduce OOP concepts while giving students **hands-on web development experience**.

## Why Teach with BOOTS?

BOOTS offers a structured, engaging curriculum that aligns with modern software development. Here’s why it stands out:

### 🚀 **Teaches Core OOP Principles**
BOOTS covers:
- Classes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
- Encapsulation and Composition
- Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- Exception Handling and Unit Testing

### 🌍 **Industry-Relevant Web Development**
BOOTS ensures students get practical experience with:
- **TypeScript** as a strongly-typed, modern language
- **Webz**, a lightweight Angular-inspired frontend framework
- **HTML & CSS**, allowing students to build real web applications

### 🔥 **Engaging, Hands-On Learning**
- **Interactive textbook** with runnable TypeScript code ([📖 BOOTS Textbook](https://boots-edu.github.io/textbook/))
- **Weekly autograded programming assignments**
- **Final web-based projects** that reinforce OOP through real applications

### 🔧 **Easy-to-Adopt Teaching Materials**
BOOTS provides:
- 📚 **Full textbook** with code examples
- 🎓 **Editable lecture slides**
- 📝 **Programming problem sets with autograding**
- 🛠️ **The Webz framework** for simplified web development ([🛠️ Webz](https://boots-edu.github.io/Webz/))

## Course Structure

BOOTS follows a structured **13-week curriculum**, progressively introducing OOP and web concepts:
